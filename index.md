## FAQ

#### Is this change permanent?

If you only choose to change the speed limit, the official app may overwrite it depending on the platform and your bike version. You can also remove the limit completely which can only be reverted with Bronco _version Unleashed_.

#### How do I revert this?

Go to speed setting, tap "Enable speed limit", set speed to 25, tap "Apply".

#### Can I use this instead of the official app?

Bronco Unleashed features a rudimentary dashboard which provides all the information that the official app does, except the map. You will probably want to use a standalone navigation app anyway, because the official one sucks. Right? 

#### Notification? why?

Due to how the dashboard works, the app requires a background service. At this point I may as well show the info as a notification. If you don't like it, you can deny the app from pushing notifications in Android settings.

#### Who is responsible if this f\*cks my bike up?

You. I don't give you any guarantee that this app will even work so use it at your own risk.

#### I liked the old app more.

[You can still get it](https://github.com/hackboyMcHack/bronco/releases/download/1.0.0/Bronco.apk).
