## FAQ

#### Is this change permanent?

You have the choice of changing the speed limit, which would work until you connect the official app again, or disabling it completely, which can only be reverted using Bronco Unleashed.

#### How do I revert this?

Go to speed setting, tap "Enable speed setting", set speed to 25, tap "Apply".

#### Can I use this instead of the official app?

Bronco Unleashed features a rudimentary dashboard which provides all the information that the official app does, except the map. You will probably want to use a standalone navigation app anyway, because the official navigation sucks. Right? 

#### Notification? why?

Due to how the dashboard works, the app requires a background service. At this point I may as well show the info as a notification. If you don't like it, you can deny the app from pushing notifications in Android settings.

#### Who is responsible if it f**ks my bike up?

You. I don't give you any guarantee that this app will even work so use it at your own risk.
